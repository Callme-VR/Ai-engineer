## Environment Setup

A virtual environment `.venv` has been created with the following libraries:

- Jupyter (Notebook/Lab)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to use in VS Code

1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Open any `.ipynb` file (e.g., `setup_test.ipynb`).
3. In the top-right corner of the notebook editor, click **Select Kernel**.
4. Choose **Python Environments**.
5. Select the environment corresponding to `.venv` (it should display `MachineProjects`).

## Running the Test Notebook

Open `setup_test.ipynb` and run the cells to verify everything is working correctly.
